### How do I know if my company is affected?

- If it is possible to sign up over phone or in person

AND

- If you are requiring an email address for signing up

You are probably affected.

### How do I know if my personal data is affected?

I don't read or process the emails that are coming in.
The only information that was available to me was the sender domain to notify the company to stop sending me mails.
Therefor I can't supply you with information about if your personal data is or was involved for the domain names that are under my control.
Other domain names might be controlled by malicious users.

### Are there certain kinds of companies that are more likely to be affected?

Yes.

This affects mostly companies that supply a service or product that is not online. For example:

- TV connection
- Cell phone plan
- Internet connection
- Utilities (electricity)

### Are there age groups that are more affected than others?

Yes. As discussed with several companies when notifying them about this issue: As people without an email address are either very young or very old<sup><a href="https://longreads.cbs.nl/ict-kennis-en-economie-2022/ict-gebruik-bij-personen/">1</a></sup>, and most bigger purchases are done by grown ups, this affects mostly elderly.
To make even worse, this is also a demographic more affected by scams<sup>2</sup>

### Do you have access to all this personal data?

As I am the owner of several of these domains, I theoretically have the ability to read these emails.
As this data is personal, I don't look at it for ethical reasons.

In the past, I have set up automatic processes to gather statistics about the _sender domains_.
This was used to contact the companies and notify them about this issue.

You don't even have to believe me on my blue eyes. Right now, all DNS records related to email are removed so all automatic processing is disabled.
The only DNS settings that are still there are related to the hosting of the redirects to this domain.

### Why are you doing this?

I am a software developer who also likes to think about security.
The domains are solely under my control to mitigate the issue and prevent others from registering these domains with malicious intent.

### How are you paying for this?

I am paying for these domain names every year out of my own pocket. That's also the reason that I stopped paying for the other 25 domains that got very minimal email traffic compared to these three remaining domain names.
